I am a Software Engineer at
<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>.
I am part of the
<a href="https://www.google.com/safesearch" target="_blank">SafeSearch</a>
team, we work on algorithms to hide undesired explicit content in Search results.

I did my PhD in Formal Methods (Computer Science) at
<a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/home/" target="_blank">IST Austria</a>.
My PhD advisor was
<a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/" target="_blank">Krishnendu Chatterjee</a>.
My PhD topic was verification of concurrent programs.

I was a three-time research intern at Google, twice in Mountain View
and once in Zürich.

# In summers 2018 and 2019 I interned at Google Research Mountain View,
# working on machine learning in higher-order theorem proving.

# In summer 2020 I interned at Google Research Zürich,
# working on machine learning in music.
