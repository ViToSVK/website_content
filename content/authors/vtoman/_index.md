I am a PhD student in Formal Methods (Computer Science) at
<a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/home/" target="_blank">IST Austria</a>.
My PhD advisor is
<a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/" target="_blank">Krishnendu Chatterjee</a>.
My PhD topic is verification of concurrent programs.

In summers 2018 and 2019 I interned at Google Research Mountain View,
working on machine learning in higher-order theorem proving.

In summer 2020 I interned at Google Research ZÃ¼rich,
in the area of on-device machine learning.
